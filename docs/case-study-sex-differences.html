        <h2>Historical Context and Measurement Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Sex differences in cognitive abilities have been studied scientifically for over a century. The foundational psychometric finding, established by the mid-twentieth century, is that males and females show negligible differences in general intelligence (g) as measured by full-scale IQ tests [SOURCE 1]. This parity in overall ability coexists with reliable differences in specific cognitive domains.</p>
        <p>The appropriate statistical framework emphasizes effect sizes (Cohen's d) rather than statistical significance. Most cognitive sex differences fall in the small-to-medium range (d = 0.15–0.50), implying substantial overlap between male and female distributions [SOURCE 1].</p>
        <p>An additional consideration is the greater male variability hypothesis, which posits that males show greater variance in cognitive abilities. Evidence for this has been reported in mathematical and spatial abilities, with the ratio of male to female variance typically ranging from 1.05 to 1.20, though its magnitude and universality remain debated [SOURCE 4].</p>
        <p>The measurement of cognitive sex differences depends critically on specific tasks and instruments employed. Mental rotation tasks consistently show the largest male advantages, while verbal fluency and perceptual speed tasks show the largest female advantages. The choice of test battery substantially influences the observed magnitude and direction of differences [SOURCE 1].</p>

        <h2>Spatial Reasoning: Magnitude, Domains, and Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Sex differences in spatial reasoning are among the most robust findings in differential psychology. "Spatial reasoning" encompasses several dissociable abilities, each with a different pattern of sex difference.</p>
        <p><strong>Mental rotation</strong> — the ability to mentally rotate two- or three-dimensional objects — shows the largest and most consistent male advantage, with meta-analytic effect sizes of d = 0.50–1.00 [SOURCE 4]. Males excel in tasks requiring mental visualization, rotation, and transformation of spatial and visual information across cultures, age groups, and testing conditions [SOURCE 1].</p>
        <p><strong>Spatial perception</strong> shows a moderate male advantage (d ≈ 0.40). <strong>Spatial visualization</strong> — involving complex, multi-step spatial manipulation — shows a smaller and less consistent male advantage (d ≈ 0.15–0.25) [SOURCE 4].</p>
        <p>The supramodal nature of these differences was demonstrated by a study showing that males demonstrate superior performance in sound localization tasks requiring extraction of spatial information from auditory scenes [SOURCE 3]. This implies a domain-general spatial processing advantage rather than one specific to visual input.</p>
        <p><strong>Hormonal accounts</strong> emphasize the organizational effects of prenatal androgens on brain development. Women's mental rotation performance varies across the menstrual cycle, and women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) show enhanced spatial performance relative to unaffected controls [SOURCE 4].</p>
        <p><strong>Experience-based accounts</strong> emphasize sex differences in spatial activities. Spatial training studies demonstrate that abilities are substantially trainable and that sex differences can be reduced, though not typically eliminated, through targeted training [SOURCE 1].</p>
        <p>Spatial anxiety and spatial ability are significant mediators of gender differences in math anxiety, with manipulation anxiety being the strongest mediator [SOURCE 1]. This indicates that spatial reasoning differences interact with affective factors to influence performance in mathematically demanding domains.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Verbal Abilities: Components and Neurophysiological Correlates</h2>
        <p>Female advantages in verbal abilities are well-documented, though effect sizes are generally smaller and more variable than the male spatial advantage.</p>
        <p><strong>Verbal fluency</strong> consistently shows a female advantage (d = 0.20–0.35) [SOURCE 3]. Females also outperform males in <strong>verbal memory</strong> and <strong>perceptual speed</strong>. <strong>Reading comprehension and writing quality</strong> show reliable female advantages with practical significance in educational contexts — girls consistently outperform boys in reading and writing across multiple countries [SOURCE 3].</p>
        <p>EEG studies have found that interhemispheric correlation in the alpha band is significantly higher in women than in men, suggesting different patterns of cerebral functional organization [SOURCE 5]. Women exhibit lower hemispheric differentiation — greater functional connectivity between hemispheres — which may support bilateral language processing.</p>
        <p>The bilateral language processing hypothesis proposes that females engage both hemispheres during language tasks to a greater extent than males. Subsequent meta-analyses of fMRI language lateralization studies have produced mixed results, and the current consensus is that sex differences in language lateralization are small, variable, and potentially task-dependent [SOURCE 5].</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Mathematical Performance: Ability, Anxiety, and Achievement</h2>
        <p>Sex differences in mathematical performance present a nuanced picture. On standardized tests, the male advantage has declined from approximately d = 0.30 in the 1970s to d = 0.05–0.10 in recent assessments [SOURCE 11]. In some East Asian countries, girls now match or exceed boys.</p>
        <p>However, male overrepresentation at the upper tail persists. The male-to-female ratio among top SAT-Mathematics scorers has declined from approximately 13:1 in the 1980s to approximately 3:1, but remains above parity [SOURCE 4].</p>
        <p>Females experience substantially higher levels of math anxiety, which is negatively associated with performance and positively associated with avoidance [SOURCE 1]. The gender gap in math anxiety is larger than the gap in math performance, suggesting that affective factors may constrain female achievement more than ability differences.</p>
        <p>At the university level, females show improved academic performance relative to males in many STEM courses [SOURCE 12]. Female students outperform males in some courses including computer science when measured by course grades [SOURCE 11]. Motivational differences are also observed: females are more likely to choose STEM fields for altruistic reasons, while males are more motivated by financial rewards [SOURCE 13].</p>

        <h2>Neuroanatomical Correlates: Structure, Development, and Function</h2>
        <p>Neuroanatomical sex differences provide biological context, though the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance is complex.</p>
        <p><strong>Brain volume:</strong> Males have larger total brain volumes. After controlling for body size, the difference narrows to approximately 2–5%, and its cognitive significance is debated. Within-sex correlations between total brain volume and intelligence are modest (r ≈ 0.25–0.30) [SOURCE 16].</p>
        <p><strong>Subcortical structures:</strong> The amygdala exhibits sex-specific growth patterns, with males showing steeper volume increases during early development [SOURCE 16]. Sex differences in amygdala development may influence emotional and social behaviors interacting with cognitive performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Structural MRI studies identify the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex as key predictors of cognitive decline, with distinct volume reduction patterns across age and sex groups [SOURCE 14].</p>
        <p><strong>White matter:</strong> Some studies report greater within-hemisphere connectivity in males and greater between-hemisphere connectivity in females, consistent with differential support for visuospatial integration and language processing respectively [SOURCE 5]. White matter hyperintensities are more prevalent in older women, possibly linked to the menopausal transition [SOURCE 18].</p>
        <p><strong>Hormonal influences:</strong> Sex hormones exert both organizational effects (prenatal development) and activational effects (puberty and adulthood). These interact with genetic sex (XX vs. XY) to produce observed neuroanatomical differences [SOURCE 16].</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Environmental, Cultural, and Educational Influences</h2>
        <p>Environmental and cultural influences play a substantial role. Cross-national comparisons show that nations with greater gender equality tend to show smaller math performance gaps and larger female reading advantages [SOURCE 11]. In some highly egalitarian countries, the math gap has disappeared or reversed.</p>
        <p><strong>Stereotype threat</strong> — awareness that one's group is negatively stereotyped in a domain — reduces female performance on math tests. Interventions reducing stereotype threat can improve female performance [SOURCE 1].</p>
        <p><strong>Educational practices</strong> contribute to observed differences. The magnitude of spatial and mathematical sex differences varies substantially across educational systems [SOURCE 12].</p>
        <p>The narrowing of the math gender gap over the past fifty years, coinciding with increased gender equality, suggests that environmental changes can alter the magnitude of cognitive sex differences [SOURCE 11]. However, the persistence of certain differences (particularly mental rotation) despite substantial cultural change suggests that biological factors also contribute.</p>

        <h2>Falsifiability Criteria</h2>
        <p>Evidence that would contradict or substantially revise this synthesis:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elimination of the mental rotation sex difference through spatial training, demonstrating it is entirely experiential</li>
          <li>Discovery that cross-national variation is fully explained by measurement artifacts rather than genuine cultural moderation</li>
          <li>Neuroanatomical findings showing negligible sex differences when corrected for body size and unrelated to cognitive performance</li>
          <li>Longitudinal evidence that differences are absent in infancy and emerge solely from differential socialization</li>
          <li>Demonstration that greater male variability is a statistical artifact of test construction</li>
