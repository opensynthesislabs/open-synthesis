## Synthesis

The heritability of intelligence, often denoted as IQ, has been extensively studied using twin designs, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other methodologies, revealing a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

### Twin Studies on Heritability of Intelligence

Twin studies consistently report that intelligence is highly heritable. For instance, a longitudinal study of 483 same-sex twin pairs assessed from ages 1 to 16 revealed a decreasing influence of shared environment and an increasing influence of heritability across development, with large and increasing age-to-age stability of genetic influences [SOURCE 5]. Similarly, another study analyzing data from 209 twin pairs at multiple ages (5, 7, 10, and 12 years) found significant heritabilities at all ages, with genetic influences being the primary driver of continuity in general cognitive ability [SOURCE 4].

These findings are corroborated by a study of 7-year-old Dutch twin pairs, which found that intelligence, as assessed by psychometric IQ tests, correlated negatively with childhood psychopathology, primarily explained by common genetic factors [SOURCE 3]. Additionally, a study of 11,000 children (including 749 twin pairs) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study identified that executive functions (EFs) and IQ are phenotypically correlated, with their genetic correlation (rG) being close to 1, indicating that they are genetically inseparable in middle childhood [SOURCE 2].

However, there is some variability in the magnitude of heritability estimates across different populations and studies. For example, an interaction between socioeconomic status (SES) and the heritability of IQ, such that heritability increases with higher SES, has been reported in some US twin studies but not consistently in others or in studies outside the US [SOURCE 1]. This suggests that while genetic factors play a significant role, their impact can be moderated by environmental factors like SES.

### Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)

GWAS have begun to identify specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. A genome-wide association study for general IQ found that polygenic scores (PGS) for intelligence are associated with general IQ (gIQ), along with epigenetic modifications of the DRD2 gene, gray matter density in the striatum, and functional striatal activation [SOURCE 10]. Another study using twin data found that common environmental influences on negative affect are amplified for children with a lower IQ-PGS, highlighting the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors [SOURCE 9].

Moreover, a study integrating neuroimaging and genetic data found that the covariance between cortical thickness (CT) and IQ is nearly entirely genetically mediated, with shared genetic factors driving the CT-IQ relationships in the developing brain [SOURCE 7].

### Interaction Between Genetic and Environmental Factors

Several studies have explored how environmental factors interact with genetic influences on intelligence. For example, a study of 7-year-old children found that common environmental influences on negative affect are amplified for those with a lower IQ-PGS, indicating a genotype-environment interaction [SOURCE 9]. Another study showed that the heritability of reading disability varies as a function of IQ, with higher heritability estimates in children with higher IQ scores [SOURCE 8].

Additionally, a study of white matter microstructure found that genetic influences on fiber integrity vary with age, sex, SES, and IQ, with higher heritability in those with above-average IQ [SOURCE 13]. This highlights the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in understanding the heritability of intelligence.

### Summary of Key Findings

- **Heritability**: Intelligence is highly heritable, with estimates ranging from 53% to 86% depending on the population and age group [SOURCE 2, SOURCE 4, SOURCE 5].
- **Twin Studies**: Longitudinal twin studies consistently show that genetic factors are the main drivers of continuity in cognitive ability, with shared environmental influences playing a role in both stability and change [SOURCE 4, SOURCE 5].
- **GWAS**: Polygenic scores for intelligence are associated with general IQ, and epigenetic modifications, gray matter density, and functional brain activation are also linked to IQ [SOURCE 10].
- **Gene-Environment Interactions**: Environmental factors like SES and IQ can moderate genetic influences on intelligence, with higher heritability estimates in higher SES environments and among children with higher IQ [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 9, SOURCE 13].

### Evidence Not Shown

While the evidence strongly supports the heritability of intelligence, it does not fully explain the "missing heritability," i.e., the gap between twin study estimates and the variance explained by identified genetic markers [SOURCE 10]. Additionally, the exact mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors interact to influence intelligence remain to be elucidated.

### Falsifiability Criteria

Evidence that would contradict the synthesis includes:
- A finding that the heritability of intelligence decreases significantly with age, contrary to the trend observed in longitudinal twin studies.
- Identification of a single genetic variant with a large effect size that explains a substantial portion of the variance in IQ, without the need for polygenic scores.
- Demonstration that environmental factors alone, without genetic mediation, can account for the majority of the variance in IQ across different populations.

These findings would challenge the current understanding of the heritability of intelligence and its interaction with environmental factors.
