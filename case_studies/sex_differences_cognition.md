## Synthesis

The peer-reviewed literature reveals consistent sex differences in various cognitive abilities, particularly in spatial reasoning, verbal ability, and mathematical performance, alongside corresponding neuroanatomical correlates.

### Spatial Reasoning

Sex differences in spatial reasoning are well-documented, with males generally outperforming females in tasks that involve spatial processing, such as mental visualization, rotation, and transformation of spatial and visual information [SOURCE 1]. For instance, males tend to excel in visuospatial tasks like figure rotation and surface development [SOURCE 4], and they demonstrate superior performance in sound localization tasks that require extracting spatial information from an auditory scene [SOURCE 3]. These advantages appear to be supramodal, extending beyond the visual domain to auditory processing [SOURCE 3].

Moreover, spatial anxiety and spatial ability are important mediators of gender differences in math anxiety, with manipulation anxiety being the strongest mediator [SOURCE 1]. This indicates that spatial reasoning not only differs between sexes but also interacts with emotional and cognitive factors influencing mathematical performance.

### Verbal Ability

Females typically outperform males in verbal fluency, verbal memory, and perceptual speed [SOURCE 3]. Additionally, interhemispheric correlation in the alpha band is significantly higher in women than in men at several cortical sites, suggesting a different pattern of cerebral functional organization, with women exhibiting lower hemispheric differentiation [SOURCE 5]. This neurophysiological distinction may underpin the observed superiority of females in verbal tasks.

### Mathematical Performance

While females do not consistently underperform males in mathematics, they tend to experience higher levels of math anxiety, which is associated with lower math performance and greater math avoidance [SOURCE 1]. This anxiety is influenced by spatial processing abilities, particularly manipulation anxiety and ability, which mediate the gender difference in math anxiety [SOURCE 1]. Furthermore, females are more likely to choose STEM fields for altruistic reasons, such as helping people and society, whereas males are motivated by financial rewards [SOURCE 13]. Despite these tendencies, female students can outperform their male counterparts in traditional STEM courses, especially in computer science [SOURCE 11].

At the university level, females show improved academic performance relative to males, possibly due to factors like teaching methodologies, parental support, and advocacy campaigns promoting women's empowerment [SOURCE 12]. However, males continue to excel in certain aspects of STEM, such as in online learning environments [SOURCE 11].

### Neuroanatomical Correlates

Neuroanatomical differences also contribute to the observed sex differences in cognitive abilities. For example, the amygdala exhibits sex-specific growth patterns, with males showing steeper increases in volume compared to females during early development [SOURCE 16]. These differences might influence emotional and social behaviors, which in turn can affect cognitive performance [SOURCE 16].

Additionally, structural MRI studies reveal that the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex are key predictors of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with distinct volume reductions observed across age and sex groups. Younger males and females show volume decreases in the right hippocampus, while older males exhibit reductions in the left inferior temporal cortex, and females in the left middle temporal cortex [SOURCE 14]. These findings suggest that sex-specific neuroanatomical patterns play a role in cognitive functions, potentially impacting spatial and mathematical abilities.

Furthermore, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are associated with cognitive decline, are more prevalent in older women, possibly linked to the menopausal transition [SOURCE 18]. This implies that hormonal changes during menopause may influence brain structure and function, thereby affecting cognitive performance.

### Summary of Findings

The evidence strongly supports the presence of sex differences in spatial reasoning, verbal ability, and mathematical performance, with corresponding neuroanatomical correlates. These differences are influenced by both cognitive and affective factors, such as anxiety and self-concept, and are evident across various developmental stages and educational contexts.

However, the evidence does not fully clarify whether these differences are primarily due to innate factors or environmental influences, such as gender stereotypes and educational practices. Moreover, while some studies report consistent sex differences, others note variability depending on the specific task, context, and individual characteristics [SOURCE 11].

### Falsifiability Criteria

Evidence that would contradict the synthesis includes findings showing no significant sex differences in cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks and contexts, or demonstrating that these differences diminish with equal opportunities and interventions aimed at reducing gender bias. Additionally, if neuroanatomical differences were found to be negligible or if they did not correspond with cognitive performance variations, this would challenge the current understanding of sex differences in cognitive abilities.
